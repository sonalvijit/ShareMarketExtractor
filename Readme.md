# Share Market Extractor

`#` A personal side project to log and track potential share market entries for future investment decisions.

`#` This tool helps me keep a structured record of stock opportunities, price levels, and relevant notes for long-term and short-term investments. It's designed for personal use but can be extended into a more feature-rich investment tracking app.
